# Overview of vkit

## Introduction

[vkit](https://github.com/vkit-dev/vkit) is a toolkit designed for CV (Computer Vision) developers, especially targeting document image analysis and optical character recognition workloads.

* Supporting rich data enhancement approaches
  * Common photometric distortion such as various colorspace manipulation methods and various image noise related techniques
  * ‚≠ê Common geometric distortion such as various affine transformations, non-linear transformations (e.g. Similarity MLS, camera-model based 3D surface, folding effect, etc.)
  * ‚≠ê Simultaneously transforming labels data while performing geometric distortion. As an example, while an image was rotated, vkit will rotate the corresponding locational label data at the same time without manual intervention.
* Supporting comprehensive data type encapsulation and visualization support
  * Image type (encapsulation based on PIL, supporting reading/writing various image file type)
  * Label type: mask, score map, box, polygon and so on
* Industrial grade code quality
  * Code-completion and type hint friendly, making it practical to be used in production
  * Matured package and dependency management
  * Automated code style enforcement (based on flake8) and static type checker (based on pyright)

Remarks:
* üöß Work in progress, not fully supported
* ‚≠ê Highlights (features that other similar projects have not, or not elegantly implemented)

## Objective

The author, as a CV/NLP engineer, wishes to bring convenience to developers in the aforementioned disciplines through this project:

* Free developers from the tedious data governance tasks, therefore more time can be spent on actual meaningful development work such as the data governance strategies, model designing and fine tuning
* Consolidate common data enhancement techniques, aiming to aid document image analysis and recognition researches, and their industrial practices. The author wishes to make the "secret sauce", i.e. the industrial grade data enrichment methods, available to public
* Construct open-source industrial document image analysis and recognition solutions:
  * Distortion correction
  * Hyper resolution
  * OCR
  * Layout Analysis

## Installation

Python version requirement: 3.8 and 3.9 (No plan to support Python version lower than 3.8 due to third-party package dependency complications)

To install the development version (the latest commit in main branch):

```bash
pip install python-vkit-nightly
```

To install the stable release:

```bash
pip install python-vkit
```

Your kind understanding will be greatly appreciated if the response is slow on these forums as the author is busy with his work while he cannot devote his full time into this project.
